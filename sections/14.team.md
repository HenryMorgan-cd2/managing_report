## Overview

**Reece** seems to do most of the development - he clearly had expertise in the field, however, I feel his work did not allow others in the group to contribute equally. In their rehearsal demo he was the sole person to present. I feel this demonstrates poor team work.

**George** and **Jana** produced little, only getting involved in the final few weeks. **Jacques** and **Timothy** were a key contributors for the reports. **Benjamin** did not seem to contribute.
