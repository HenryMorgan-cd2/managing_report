## Overview

This team produced a poor system which did not meet even the minimum requirements of the specification.

The team was obsessed with their own internal heirachy. This is apparent by their first two reports, both of which start off by talking about the assignment of a leader.

The team assigned a single person initially to the reports. Which, in hindsight, is greatly unbalanced for what the project demanded.

- Nischal was a very dominant personality often interrupting others in the weekly meetings.
- This team did not seem to work well

| Nischal Limbu  | 7                  | His controlling and dominant nature seemed to negatively impact the entire team. I believe without him they would have performed better. He did seem to understand the system relatively well.                                   | 3              |
| Rachel Hill    | 7                  | Over the course of the project she seemed to become less pleased with the team, ending with the final meeting being very depressed seeming and remained completely silent. She was assigned the entire work load of the reports. | 10             |
