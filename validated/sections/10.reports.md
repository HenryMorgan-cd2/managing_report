# Weekly Reports

The weekly reports were designed to act like a time sheet, recording every time someone worked on the project. They were comprised of a series of records each containing a brief description of what was achieved, when the work was done and who participated in the work.

They were very effective at recording ....

Team 20 was under the predominant managment of a different manager which resulted in the team having to complete a different style of report. This report had the teams assign tasks for what would be completed in the following week. These reports were not overly useful, they contained almost no information. For example, one week they provided a table of containing everyone's names alongside the tasks for the upcoming week. For five of the people their tasks simply consisted of: "Create WordPress account" and "Start developing prototype". With the sixth person tasked to write next weeks report and "Help organize meetings". I do not believe that these tasks benefit the managers nor the team, the tasks are two general and have no defined completion criteria.

<!-- ### Problems -->

Initially I described the reports as recording all the meetings the team had concerning the project. This was a mistake as it resulted in teams only recording times when multiple members would meet to discuss and plan out the system. I clarified, to every team, exactly what I expected to be recorded when I realized this confusion.

There were many instances during the project where teams would add something to their reports which seemed wrong. For instance, one way CMSs are beneficial is that they package many features into a single tool, one of which is a user system. Team 8, however, included in one of their reports: "We also have developed a login system to the website". This indicates that they are attempting to inflate the amount of work they are presenting or have a fundamental misunderstanding of their CMS. Either way it is something that should be addressed. I, however, elected to not confront the group and instead sought avoid conflict which, in hindsight, was detrimental to the team and goes directly against my intentions for hypothesis 4.

When creating the final summary report this was the first time I had reviewed a teams actual progress accross multiple weeks. Previously I would be looking at a single weeks progress in isolation. When reviewing the teams overall progress I noticed many inconsistencies within some of the teams. For instance, team 18 stated in both the 6th and 7th development week report that they "started the testing report". This clearly shows that the team was not truthful in the weekly reports which is an exact issue I raised in the first report and was the underlying reasoning for collecting actual work entries in the reports rather than a future plan.

<!-- ### Future Plan -->

- Final Summary
- The meeting tracking worked very well when used as I intended it to be
  - many teams missed the point of it. Better explanation would improve it

In the future I would create a work timeline (as shown in the experience report) for each group as the project progressed. This would mean I would be able to review the weeks report in the context of all previous progress, allowing me to notice any problems within the team such as idling members (as in team 5), or feature regression (something present in team 20).

- Some teams didn't start development until 4 weeks in, this should have been a red flag.

I would also be more transparent with their usage

I think that one major way the reports could be improved would be to be more transparent with their usage. If I informed the teams at the beginning that would be used to determine how much progress is being made. One, additional, way I could achieve this transparency would be make the timeline available for the groups. This was they could self-reflect and be a longer term reminder of what they have accomplished.

- Tell the people that I will be using the weekly reports to assess them at the end. I believe this would make the groups keep more accurate and complete records of who was doing what. It
