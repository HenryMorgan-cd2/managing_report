# Teaching Management

The main way I had planned to teach management to the teams was to have them read about and select which of Belbins team roles most applied to them. every member was presented with a list of the roles and a description each one as well as a high level overview of what the roles were for. The purpose of this exercise was to get each member thinking about their place within a team and to have them realise what there skills were in a team environment.

It was found that every team (except one) had at least a single person for all roles barring the _resource investigator_. This mean

There was a single team that lacked the _completer finisher_ role.

- Hypothesis 3
  - One thing I did not realise at the beginning was that students lacked motivation and reason to dedicate extra time learning about management methodology. I still believe that the knowledge of the subject would improve a teams performance, as clarity of reasoning can help guide people into following directions, however, individuals need to be given reason to want to learn.
  - When I manage people in the future I shall be more aware of this need for motivation, and explain to the people the exact reason why they should be interested in learning and more specifically how this would benefit them directly.

* The rate in which teams filled in their roles seemed to correlate roughly with the performance of the team. Members who were slow tended to be poorer performers then those who completed it quickly.
