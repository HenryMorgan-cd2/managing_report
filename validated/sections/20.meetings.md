# Weekly Meetings

<!--
During each meeting I planned to gather a list of specific tasks. I then would cross-reference this task list with the following weeks report. It would allow me to ensure work is evenly distrubted and progress is actually being made. It would also further hypothesis 4 as I would be directly involved with the planning process, further hypothesis 1 as I would be able to redistribute work and make sure everyone is involved, and hypothesis 2 as I could ensure the task is broken into sufficiently small sub-sets. -->

The weekly meetings for the most part were wasted time. I failed to take advantage of them properly.

Each meeting consisted of asking what the team had done.

Instead they mainly acted as a way for me to touch base with the group, and query as to whether there were any issues. Occasionally the groups would ask

In the third week of meeting I asked each team to make a start on their testing report. I told them that this report could be done almost entirely independently of system development and should be fully done as quickly as possible. By doing the test report early it force teams to think about exactly what features they needed and would set out a set of criteria to determine when a particular feature is done - if the tests pass, the feature is complete. This is a decision that I am very happy to have made.

## Final Demonstrations

During the final week of meetings each team presented a demonstration of their system. The demos were meant to be a practise run of what they were going to present to the lecturers. This allowed the teams to receive feedback on their system and the presentation style. The teams were briefed the week prior and were told they should be rehearsed demos where everyone is involved and the complete system is presented via use cases i.e a ticket being created, assigned, and solved.

Although we had been presented with demonstrations prior to this one, this one turned out to be much more useful in terms of gauging progress and providing feedback. Having the system shown in a rehersed manner with user storeies allowed us to spot missing features or potential errors. Where as in prior demos we would be shown isolated parts of the system and it was hard to fully grasp how everything fit together in the larger picture - though at the time I did not realise this was the case.

## Future Changes

I would ask for the testing report in the first week.

I would inform teams about the entirety of my plans.

In the future I have the teams perform rehearsed demos every week. I believe doing this would make the teams focus on features which actually matter. For instance, some teams spent many weeks on design, however, if they had to present their system every week it would likely force the team to make tangible progress as it would be hard for them to justify nothing really changing in the system.

This style of demonstration also see who was and was not familiar with the system. If done regularly it would be easier to determine if someone had not contributed to the work effort which would allow be to delegate and balance work loads, helping with hypothesis 1.

Another thing I would do differently is speak to the assessors before the project in order to understand exactly what they are looking for in a good presentation. I made the assumption that, since the module is a group project, they would want to see everybody involved in the presentation. I instructed the teams that this was the case and even criticized one team for only having a single person do everything. Although I think that this is a feature of a good presentation, confirming it would have been good to ensure the information the teams are given is accurate.
