# Evaluation

Overall, I think, the managment style contained many good ideas the meetings style being one of the best. But there were many things which could have been improved.

## Future Improvements

- Read through my hypothesis frequently.
  - Realised while writing this report that I had forgotten three of the hypothesis

## Module Improvements

- Review weekly meetings each week
  - more realistic
  - benifit the managers by keeping them focussed
  - Help to focus on the individual
  - Posco asked us after the final meeting to rate each member individually. We were not able to do this as accurately as I would have liked as I had not kept notice on an individual basis.

## Updated Hypothesis

# Conclusion

Overall this module provided the opportunity for many new and interesting ideas.
