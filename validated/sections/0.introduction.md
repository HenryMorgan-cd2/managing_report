This report covers my experience with managing the different teams and how my hypothesis, set out in the first semester, worked in practise. The report ends with how my management technique would differ in the future.

# My Hypothesis

I had four main hypothesis going in to the project:

1. Teams are comprised of many individuals each with their own needs and desires, if attention is focused on fulfilling these requirements, for each person separately, then the entire team will prosper.
2. Large projects are hard for people to fully digest and work on effectively, therefore, they need to be broken into small achievable tasks. This not only helps to focus work but also to track progress of the team.
3. An understanding of how teams operate and how management can be the most effective would benefit teams. It would allow them to organize more effectively and help to motivate the following of instructions.
4. Teams should take advantage of the experience of their managers. This can only be effective if the team believes that the managers are invested in the project and it's success. Therefore, by playing an active role in the team I can posit the idea of interest encouraging them to utilize me as a resource as they do each other.
